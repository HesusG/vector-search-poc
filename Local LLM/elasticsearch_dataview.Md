# Elastic

Elastic is a powerful search and analytics engine commonly used for real-time data analysis and visualization.

## Elastic API

To interact with the Elastic API using `curl`, you can perform various operations such as indexing, searching, updating, and deleting documents within an Elasticsearch cluster. Here's a basic example of how to use `curl` with the Elastic API:

```bash
# Example of indexing a document into Elasticsearch
curl -X POST "http://localhost:9200/my-index/_doc" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{
  "user": "john",
  "message": "Hello World"
}'
```

## Dataview for Elastic

In Elastic, a DataView is used to define how data fields should be displayed in visualizations and dashboards created with Kibana. Below is an example of defining custom labels for fields in a DataView using a POST request to the Kibana API:

```json
POST kbn:/api/data_views/data_view/458cc523-89ee-4c1e-b9a9-15df9d2c9b10/fields
{
  "fields": {
    "product.stage_id_name.keyword": {
      "customLabel": "Product Stage Id Name Keyword"
    },
    "invoice.invoice_date": {
      "customLabel": "Invoice Invoice Date"
    },
    "product.id": {
      "customLabel": "Product Id"
    }
  }
}
```

This request updates the DataView identified by `458cc523-89ee-4c1e-b9a9-15df9d2c9b10`, specifying custom labels for specific fields to improve readability and understanding in visualizations created using Kibana.
