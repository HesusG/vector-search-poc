# Typing Module

The `typing` module in Python provides tools to specify the types of variables, function parameters, and return values. This helps with type checking and makes the code more understandable and maintainable. Here's an explanation of the classes imported in this project `Union`, `Generator`, and `Iterator`:

## The `typing` Module

The `typing` module is part of the standard library in Python and provides a way to specify types for variables, function parameters, and return values. This can be particularly useful for documentation, type checking, and ensuring that the code behaves as expected.

## `Union`

The `Union` type hint indicates that a value can be one of several types. In your function, you're using `Union` to specify that the return value can be either a string, a generator, or an iterator.

```python
from typing import Union
```

## `Generator`

The `Generator` type hint is used to specify that a function returns a generator. A generator is a special type of iterator that yields values one at a time and maintains its state between each yield, allowing for efficient iteration over potentially large data sets.

```python
from typing import Generator
```

## `Iterator`

The `Iterator` type hint is used to specify that a value is an iterator. An iterator is an object that implements the iterator protocol, consisting of the `__iter__()` and `__next__()` methods. Generators are a type of iterator, but not all iterators are generators.

```python
from typing import Iterator
```

## Why Import These Types?

In your function `generate_text_with_context`, you're importing these types to specify that the function can return different types of values. This helps both for documentation and for type checking by tools like mypy. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why each is used:

- **`Union`**: Indicates that the return type of `generate_text_with_context` can be a string, generator, or iterator. This is useful because it shows that the function is versatile and can handle different types of outputs.
- **`Generator`**: Used to specify that the function can return a generator, which is useful when dealing with streaming data or any situation where you want to yield items one at a time.
- **`Iterator`**: Used to indicate that the function can return an iterator. While a generator is a type of iterator, specifying both can help make it clear that the function can return any type of iterator, not just a generator.
